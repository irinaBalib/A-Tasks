For graphs visualization would use Chart.js library.
Datapoints passed to view as ViewData may be serialized to json and then given to 
Chart object(of Chart.js library) as data properties.

Not sure if library offers something for creating trends.
Other approach I would try is onClick make an Ajax calls to a separate method
which would do the calculations for the trend.
